## Review
To start the project you need to create a schema "**recipes**" in the database MySql.
At the moment there is the following functionality:
authorization, registration, viewing and changing the data of the registered user, internationalization, as well as the
admin panel, where you can view,edit,delete users, you can also delete and add a role to the user.
**ADMIN login - kamina, password - kamina**.
